<h3>Weeks 10-12: Build a Drawing Machine </h3>

<p class="margin">   </p>
<h4>Preparation: Idea Generation and Brainstorming </h4>
<p class="margin">   </p>
<p>
  Our group brainstormed a few possible ideas for the drawing machine project. We were firstly excited about developing a machine that could possibly draw on the human body as a pseudo tattoo gun type drawing experience. While we briefly flirted with the idea of making a tattoo gun it was quickly ruled out due to safety and hygiene concerns. Our second idea was using UV-activated ink or pens (glow-in-the-dark substance) as an output material. Energized by this idea, we decided to move forward with developing a Drawing Machine design from a prior student and online tutorial. We specifically took inspiration from: <a href="https://ctian5136.github.io/ps70portfolio/html/weeks/finalproject.html"> Cindy </a> and pen plotter designs from <a href="https://andrewsleigh.github.io/plotter/"> Andrew Leigh. </a>  </p>

<h4>Parts Design</h4>
<p class="margin">   </p>
<p>
  To create the pen plotter, we used stl parts from Version 3 of the Cartesian Pen Plotter with V-Slot axis. We 3D printed the parts on the Prusa printers. Our first prints came out partially incomplete, so we redid some prints a second time. We then created an organization system for all our parts in order to categorize the many motors, cables, screws, bolts and more that were necessary for assembly.

</div>
</p>

<h4>Assembly</h4>
<p class="margin">   </p>

<p>Once all of the 3D parts were correctly printed, we met to assemble the drawing machine. This was by far the most fun part of the process. We followed the photos and videos from the tutorials before us on how to connect all of the printed parts and components of assembly.  
<br>
  The only V-slot aluminum extrusion we could find was over a meter long, so we mounted the drawing machine on a long piece of plywood as a base (our particular drawing machine is quite a large scale).

<h4>Wiring</h4>
<p class="margin">   </p>
<p> <b> The following components were used in wiring the drawing machine: </b> </p>
<div>
  <ul>
<li><p> ESP32 </p></li>
<li><p>2 x Stepper Drivers </p></li>  
<li><p>2 x Nema 17 Stepper motors (17 is the physical size) </p></li>
<li><p>2 x breadboards </p></li>
<li><p>USBC transformer converts 5V to 12V </p></li> 
  </ul>
</div>
<p>
In wiring the two stepper motors for the drawing machine, we used an ESP32 to connect the motors to Arduino in order to control their movement. We wired the motors to two breadboards (one extender board) and then used the Stepper drivers to transform movement instructions from Arduino and intake voltage to power the motors. We had to include a USB-C transformer in order to convert 5V to 12V which is necessary to power two motors from an external power supply.
