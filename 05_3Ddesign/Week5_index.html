<h4>Part 1: Design and Print Something</h4>
<p class="margin">   </p>
<p><b>Motorbox for Strandbeest</b></p>
<p>
  This was my first time learning 3d printing. So I began by looking at various tutorials online to get some inspiration and instructions on the basic steps of creating a model and extruding it to print on a Prusa printer. I wanted to find some objects that would support learning about the 3d print I need to create from my final project, which is a Strandbeest kinetic sculpture (I'm pivoting to this after longer discussions with Bobby on the right final project). So I wanted to first find a simple box with a hinge that I would need to hold the motor in my final project. I found a very simple model via a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KL1aj16ynf4&t=12s"> Youtube tutorial </a> to assemble and I began going through the steps for this. I made it about halfway through designing this in Fusion, and then ran into some hurdles in navigating the tool. So I've had to stop and write down some questions to ask Bobby and or Nathan on how to proceed.

<h4>Part 2: 3D Scan with photogrammetry</h4>
<p class="margin">   </p>
<p> But in the interim, I started to explore other ways to manipulate 3D scans into 3D prints. The next part of the assignment was to make a 3D scan via photogrammetry method I particularly decided to use the app photo Polycam and scanned a candlestick holder which I then downloaded from Polycam as an STL file and brought into Fusion. In the process of doing this, I realized that I would have more fun 3D printing a bespoke 3D scan I made from objects in my world, so I decided to proceed with this approach. Working from a 3D scan also meant I would have to expand my Fusion skills by working with the mesh of the scan and maniuplating the model for printing. </p>

<p>One of the things I know about 3D scans is that they typically contain high polycounts which means that in a 3D print, there would be more surfaces of the object, and it would result in longer print time and with more data. I began by reducing the poly count in Fusion to a point where it wouldn't absolutely distort the objective of 3d scanned candlestick, but enough so that there was as few surfaces as possible. The next thing that I researched was how I can cut and reduce the overall dimensions of the 3d scanned object. When I can create a 3d scan with Polycam it picked up some surface area of the table underneath the candlestick and I needed to learn how I can redact parts of this model so it's better suitable in 3d print form. I looked up some of this online but I also got stuck so I wrote down questions to then ask Bobby and Nathan which I will do next. In order to learn how to redact the model and print it. </p>
