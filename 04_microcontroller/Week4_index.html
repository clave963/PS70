<h4>Assignment: Make an Arduino Do Something</h4>

<p class="margin">   </p> 
<p>For this week's work with microcontrollers, I wanted to build on my kinetic sculpture from last week. In order to advance to this stage,Â I first needed to replace the peg that connected the sculpture to the motor. So I reconfigured that by laser printing a wooden peg. You can see the steps for this is my video as well as some documentation from last week (Week 3).</p>

<h4>Step 1: Update Strandbeest </h4>
<p class="margin">   </p>

<p>In order to reconfigure it, I designed a new specialty peg version that had a square hole to place onto the end of the motor on one side and a circular hole for connection with the rest of the bones of the leg on the other. In updating my Fusion files, I tested out a few different offset widths because the first time I did this, the offset was too thin so the wood broke and did not stay attached to the motor. I then increased the offset by one millimeter more to a two millimeter offset. This was strong enough so that the joint would indeed catch the motor and rotate the body of the Strandbeest. </p>

  This was a first successful full motor power test of the Strandbeest rotating two legs using cardboard. In the first prototype, it was so exciting to see that motion of the legs worked correctly. Building on this, I thought it would be great to learn how to program a DC motor in order to slow down the RPM rate. </p>

<h4>Step 2: Programming a DC Motor with a Potentiometer</h4>
<p class="margin">   </p>
<p>
  I took inspiration from the code from
  <a href="https://nathanmelenbrink.github.io/lab/arduino/L9110.html"> Week 4 Class </a> on using a potentiometer to change the rate of the motor. I did an initial test of this to see if it would work correctly. So I used the microcontroller and Arduino to connect the motor and followed the steps provided. After some finicking was able to get it working and below you can see a video of the motor changing rate of speed with a potentiometer.

<p>My next steps will be to build a small box so that the Arduino can sit near the strong beast and also the motor and then connect all of the parts together so that the potentiometer can control the rate of the motor and how fast or slow the strong beast will walk. </p>
