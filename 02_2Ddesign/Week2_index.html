<p>The second week of class consisted of a three-part assignment weighted in assembling and digital modeling via Fusion 360Pro and printing physical parts. Below I detail the various assignments I completed. </p>

<h2> Assignment 1: Construct a Box</h2>
<p id="Box process">
  The assignment for this week was to construct a box from cardboard material using the Lazer printer. The first step was to assemble a digital model in Fusion 360 and ensure the parameters and finger joints were correctly defined. Once the modeling was secured, I exported my file as a .dxf file and imported into Rhino to clean up any extra lines that would lead to unwanted and prepare for laser printing.

  </div>
 
  Following assembly, I prepared the laser cutter to print a first prototype of my box. My first instance of printing resulted in an unusual mistake where the finger joints did not line up correctly along the edges of my box, thus unfortunately, I could not interlock the walls around my box.

  <div class="right-row">

  </div>

  After revisiting the model in Fusion 360, and with the help of Bobby, we extruded the model and discovered that some lines were incorrectly positioned on the base (bottom) and did not line up correctly with the sides. I fixed those edges and exported a new .dxf file to the printer. The second attempt was a success! And I printed a box ready to be assembled.

    <p class="caption">  I used hot glue to put the pieces of the box together, waited a few minutes for the glue to harden, and voila, complete.

<h2> Assignment 2: Design and print a Vector Image with the Vinyl Cutter</h2>
<p class="margin">   </p>
<p>
  The second assignment I generated was designing and printing a vector image for the vinyl printer. In order to do this I sketched an image of lightning bolt in Photopea. From there I exported the image into Inkjet in order to edit the parameters to be compatible for printing. Below you can see an overview of my process and success vinyl sticker (which I put on my box ðŸ˜‰

  The third assignment was to complete a few Fusion 360 tutorials in order to better familiarize myself with the software. Here are some screenshots of the designs I completed in the tutorials.
