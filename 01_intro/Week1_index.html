<h3>Week 1: Final Project Proposal</h3>
<p class="margin">   </p>
<p> For my Final Project in PS70 I'm interested in creating an LED light sculpture that expresses human body movement through a kinetic volumetric light design. This volumetric sculpture would take inputs of human body movement via a webcam or accelerometer and output them onto an LED grid of lights addressed through microcontrollers in a color gradient.
The movements of the body would be translated to various color patterns and arrangements. For the initial prototype, this sculpture would be a small handheld model in size.  
<br>
As I do not have prior experience in microcontrollers or light design, I imagine there will be a learning curve in programming light sequences and fabricating the LEDs.
</p>

<b> What *I think* this involve: </b>
<p class="margin">   </p>
<p>
-programmable interface for light design 
<br>
-LED strips sautered and organized into some 2D or 3D grid 
<br>
-webcam input that translates body movement to the LEDs 
</p>

<em>References and Inspiration</em>

<p>
  There are artists and technologists creating light sculptures like this at scale. I take immense inspiration from them in developing a work that can be as reactive technically and kinetically expressive. Some references include:
