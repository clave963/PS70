<h4>Mini Strandbeest</h4>
<p class="margin">   </p>
<p>
I was interested in making a kinetic sculpture that was inspired by the Dutch artist, Theo Jansen, who made the Strandbeest. These sculptures are traditionally wind powered wooden sculptures that can walk on the beach. In order to create a small version of this, I  researched different renditions and tutorials online of artisans that have created DIY versions at home or 3d printed models. A few artists online had excellent documentation and so I took inspiration from their designs to begin.</p>
<br>
<h4>Part 1: Assembling the CAD Legs</h4>
<p class="margin">   </p>
<p>
After talking with Bobby, I realized that ultimately I needed to just successfully build one leg and if I could do this, then it would be multiplication for the rest of the legs and body. So I started a new project in Fusion and attempted to recreate and assemble a model of one of the legs from an original diagram that showed all of the dimensions of Theo Jansen's the bones of one of the legs in millimeters.

<p class="caption">Original diagram of Dutch Artist Theo Jansen's Strandbeest.</p>

<p>I immediately started to run into a lot of roadblocks. Most of this was due to my limited knowledge of Fusion and trying to move or to navigate various objects; if I make an object, how can I move it? How can I create an object an angle, the design of one of the legs is very angular and composed of many polygons and triangles? I am still learning about how to do this in fusion and whether I can do this through constructing a series of lines or rectangles. I made some progress on this but had tried a number of different methods.</p>

<h4>Part 2: Building the Legs</h4>

<p>I started by drawing the lines and shapes in Fusion in order to create the bones of the legs. Once I was able to construct one bone, I then duplicated it and changed the length between the distance between points from one hole to the opposite side to the other hole based on the parameters of the diagram. It was challenging to configure the right size of the holes for the screws to go through at the end of each bone, and I ended up like using tangent lines to connect the two sides of the bones together and then create the hole. I really struggled to figure this out in Fusion so this probably took me four to five hours.  
<br>
Then I made a test print to ensure that all of the bones printed correctly and was able to successfully make one leg. I can show you some of the tutorials that I used to help guide my process in constructing the legs.

In order to put the bones together I explored different kinds of bindings. I first thought I would use dowels, but after realizing that I would need to reshuffle the order of the bones, it was easier to use screws that would enable me more degrees of freedom and error in terms of the reconfiguration (the caveat to this choice, is that the screws add more weight to each leg but I proceeded). I used M2 screws at 12 millimeter length or 20 millimeter lengths to bind all the bones together. For the legs I used one long dowel to be the body of both sides of the soon to be Strandbeest. I initially just created two legs in order to have a proof of concept. So that's what you'll see in the photos and video.

<h4>Part 3: Constructing the Body</h4>
<p class="margin">   </p>
<p>
  From there, I was able to bind the two legs together using the center beam. At this point of the process I needed to figure out if the mechanism of motion would actually work. I performed a number of manual tests where I use my hands to play with moving the center binding in order to make circular motions of both legs, and Suceess! It worked. That was a great indication that once I attached a motor to the legs, it would indeed actually move them. </p>

<h4>Part 4:Testing Leg Movement</h4>
<p class="margin">   </p>
<p>Next I decided to develop some boarding in order to help the leg stand up straight and so I recreated the autonoma boards. Spacing out the holes a little more in order to put the pegs of the body into the stand. Then using the same board I attach the motor to the board through small dowels that are holding the motor up as well as the zip tie. I put the motor through one of the holes and then attempted to connect the Strandbeest t to the motor. This was indeed the most challenging part because the motor speed was so fast that there was insufficient friciton to grab onto the cardboard and ensure it would rotate the peg. I tried different approaches to attach the motor to the cardboard peg: 
<br>
<div>
  <ul>
    <li><p> First, I stuck the cardboard peg through the end of the motor whilst suspended on the standing board. I turned on the motor to test if it would hold onto the peg without additional support, but it slipped. </p></li>
    <li><p>Then I used shrink wrap and a small dowel to extend the length of the motor. I put this through the peg and glued with super glue into place. I have a short video of this, and it worked briefly!  Then unfortunately the shrink wrap dislodged from the motor due to the high RPM. I was able to get a proof of concept working but it did not last, unfortunately, so that helped me also direct towards what my next steps are.</p> </li>
  </ul>

<h4>Part 4: Add More Legs and Next Steps </h4>
<p class="margin">   </p>
<p>My next steps are to reprint this peg that connects the legs to the motor in wood. I'm hoping wood will be a more sturdy structure. I'm reprinting this peg in a square hole that will fit snugly onto the square bracket of the motor and then I will attach that wooden peg with a square bracket to the Strandbeests' legs. I want to also reprint the legs in wood. Right now the cardboard is quite delicate and flimsy and doesn't sufficiently allow it to stand. I will prints six more legs so I'll have a total of four on each side. I can also increase that amount if it's going to create more stability. From there I will need to find a way to secure the motor onto the dowel itself which is holding up the body of the Strandbeest.</p>

<p> [Update more on this in Week 04 Now]: I assembled a new version of the peg that connects the leg of the Strandbeest to the motor in wood. I had to play with the offset degree from the edge on each side of the peg so that the wood would not break when placed around the motor. After a few trips to the lazer cutter, I successfully printed a wooden part that stayed connected to the motor. I added some spaces onto the screw that connected the peg to the bones of the Strandbeest to create some additional distance between the motor and the bones. After so much effort, failures and pivots in the process, it was SO satisfying to see the sculpture successfully move it's legs! </p>
