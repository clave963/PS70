<h4>Mini Strandbeest</h4>
<p class="margin">   </p>
<p>
I was interested in making a kinetic sculpture that was inspired by the Dutch artist, Theo Jansen, who made the Strandbeest. These sculptures are traditionally wind powered wooden sculptures that walk on the beach. In order to create a small miniature version of this, I first researched different tutorials online of artists and artisans that have created DIY versions of this at home or 3d printed models. A few artists online had 3d printed things and started to work on and design for creating the legs. So I took inspiration from their designs to begin.  
<br>
And after talking with Bobby, I realized that ultimately, I needed to just successfully build one leg and if I could do this, then it would be multiplication for the rest of the legs and body. So I started a new project in Fusion and attempted to recreate and assemble a model of one of the legs from an original diagram that showed all of the dimensions of Theo Jansen's the bones of one of the legs in millimeters. I immediately started to run into a lot of roadblocks. Most of this was due to my limited knowledge of Fusion and trying to move or to navigate various objects; if I make an object, how can I move it? How can I create an object an angle, the design of one of the legs is very angular and composed of many polygons and triangles? I am still learning about how to do this in fusion and whether I can do this through constructing a series of lines or rectangles. I made some progress on this but had tried a number of different ways. And kept running into blocks.
