  <h4>Idea Generation and Inspiration </h4>
  <p class="margin">   </p>
  <p>
    I decided to pivot my final project to the Strandbeest after I made a prototype during Kinetic Sculpture Week 03, using cardboard material and creating my own bespoke design based off of Dutch artist Theo Jansen's original proprietary kinetic sculpture design. My curiosity towards this project came from a place of interest in movement mechanics, specifically looking at robotic movement versus human movement. Additionally, I thought that doing this project was a nice integration of the various modules learned in class over this semester. I'm really happy that I went forward with this project. It was a massive learning curve for me across design and engineering technique, but I've come away with a tremendous amount of confidence in myself at building projects like this in the future. 
  <br>
  Below is a video of my Strandbeest. Following that, I'll walk through my design and fabrication process.

  <h4>Design Process</h4>
  <p class="margin">   </p>
  <p>
    The design process for this Strandbeest took place in three phases:
    <ol>
      <li>Design prototype of an initial single leg. I wanted to nail the movement mechanics of one leg and then connect to two and make sure that it would fully operate with an attached DC motor. </li>
      <li>Build the full body. For this, I built eight legs and the interconnecting pieces to hold the body together. </li>
      <li>The third phase was to connect the body with hardware in order to allow the Strandbeest to walk. </li>
    </ol>

  <h4>Phase 1: Single Leg</h4>
  <p class="margin">   </p>
  <p>In the first phase of this project, I designed a single leg in order to correctly replicate the movement mechanics. This process included developing an original design in Fusion 360, (which greatly expanded my CAD skills) that would be 3D printed. This included how to use the joint function in order to connect the interlocking bones of one single leg.   
  <br>
  My first leg design was created with screws planned to connect the bones together. In order to do this, I extruded the components and used the joint function in Fusion to connect the interlocking bones of a single leg. I then made a test print to that and tested it out the next design I prototyped was a printing place method. This method worked, but after speaking with Nathan about print-in-place alternatives, I decided to design a second leg via this method.  
  <br>
  To create the print-in-place, I extruded the end joint of all the interlocking components to create a snap-to-fit print. I made a test print to understand it's performance versus using the leg with screws. Initially there was so was so much friction and lack of movement, that I decided it wasn't worth it to print eight more legs. So I reverted back to using the model with screws to connect all the bones.

  </div>
  (After a few weeks time I did notice that the print-in-place version had more  movement and so in the future I could try this method again).  
<br>
  After this I printed a second leg and connected the two legs together in order to make sure that they could connect to the motor and move effectively together. The movement for this comes directly from Jansen's design. As a brief mock-up video, you can see this simulation how the movement from one leg impacts the movement of the other as they're connected by one center interlocking joint at the motor.. I was able to get this working while attached to a simple stand and so from there I knew that I could print the rest of the lakes and begin construction on the body.
